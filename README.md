**Library Modules**
The library is divided into **Modules**. This makes it easy to use and update.


**📥 Input Module (`read_lib`)**
       This module gets data from the user and checks if it is correct.
**Available Functions:**

       **`count_event_numbers()`** (line 91): It counts how many even numbers (like 2, 4, 6) are in the array.
       **`count_positive_numbers()`** (line 104): It counts how many positive numbers (zero or more) are in the array.
       **`count_negative_numbers()`** (line 117): It counts how many negative numbers (less than zero) are in the array.



**⚙️ Processing module (`Processing_Lib`)**
      A library to transform data into new shapes.

      **`print_digits()`** (line 25): It prints each digit of a number on a new line.
      **`sum_of_digits()`** (line 47): It adds all the digits of a number together.

      **`sum_numbers_with_array()`** (line 143): It adds all the numbers inside an array.
      **`average_number_with_array()`** (line 153): It finds the middle (average) value of the array.
      **`copy_array()`** (line 158): It copies all numbers from one array to another.
      **`copy_array_in_reversed_order()`** (line 192): It copies an array but flips the order of its numbers.
      **`sum_of_2_arrays()`** (line 167): It adds two arrays together and puts the result in a third one.
